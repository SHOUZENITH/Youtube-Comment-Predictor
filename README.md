YouTube Comment Predictor

This project was developed as a Machine Learning group project (3 members) designed to analyze and evaluate YouTube comments. It performs two main tasks:

Sentiment & Emotion Prediction â€“ Predicting whether a comment is positive/negative/neutral and detecting the underlying emotion.

Like Count Estimation â€“ Estimating the number of likes a YouTube comment might receive.

ðŸ”§ Models Used

DistilBERT (via Hugging Face)

Lightweight transformer model for sentiment and emotion classification.

XGBoost Regressor

Gradient boosting model for predicting like counts from structured features.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Due to size limits, trained models and dependencies are provided via Google Drive.

Models & node_modules â†’ Google Drive Link

Notebooks

Dataset Collection (YouTube API) â†’ Colab Notebook

Model Training â†’ Colab Notebook

ðŸš€ How It Works

Data Collection â€“ Comments are collected using the YouTube Data API.

Preprocessing â€“ Text cleaning and preparation for transformer input.

Sentiment & Emotion Analysis â€“ DistilBERT classifies comments into sentiment categories and emotions.

Like Prediction â€“ XGBoost predicts the expected number of likes based on comment text features.

ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Python 3.8+

PyTorch / TensorFlow

Hugging Face Transformers

XGBoost

Google Colab (for training & running notebooks)

ðŸ“– Usage

Download the models & dependencies from Google Drive.

Run the preprocessing & training notebooks (if retraining is needed).

Use the predictor script/notebook to analyze new YouTube comments.

ðŸ‘¥ Team

This project was built by a group of 3 students as part of a machine learning course.
